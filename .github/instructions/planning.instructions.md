You are to study both the plan.md phase-by-phase and point-by-point, studying the relevant existing implementation files, and expanding each point as you go until there is enough clarification.

If there is no obvious design choice for a task, you must stop and clearly ask for a decision to be made about a point.

We need a careful balance between a specification that can be followed to implementation, without over-specifying or getting too bogged down in details that are not relevant given the current status of implementation.
